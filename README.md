# Glue

Welcome to Glue repository. **This project is a personal experiment created with the goal of evolving my professional 
skills**.

Glue can be used as a library or even a framework, but at the end of the day Glue is nothing more than a simple IoC 
mechanism created as a experiment, acting as a placement (like a background story) to let me test libraries and best 
practices.

In another words, **Glue is a simple IoC to let me glue libraries together** (understand the name now?) **while 
applying best development practices** (such modularized development, clean code, design patterns, TDD and even DevOps) 
based in the articles and books published by the gods (like [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/)).

This project also don't target a single architecture like microservices or monolitic desktop applications, it aims to 
work in any scenario where a JVM can run.

**Glue isn't production ready**, if you're looking for a library or framework for your application is best to choose 
something like [Spring framework](https://spring.io/).
